Finally, students learn how to apply Agile techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code, a critical skill for professional programmers.\r\n\r\nOther topics covered in CS 169.2x include\r\n\r\n    How to form, organize and manage small programming teams\r\n\r\n    Introduction to design patterns: what they are and how to recognize opportunities to apply them\r\n\r\n    Using Ruby on Rails for more advanced features like third-party authentication and elegantly expressing design patterns that arise frequently in SaaS\r\nBerkeleyx'),(296,559,'2013-01-21','2013-04-08',NULL,'2012-11-02 15:57:21','2013-02-03 22:16:38','http://spanishmooc.com/','http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifpzv9PGeiA',12,'University Spanish Level 1',NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(297,560,'2012-11-05','2012-11-26',NULL,'2012-11-03 23:31:12','2013-02-03 22:16:38','https://www.openlearning.com/courses/BUS876597',NULL,3,'Services Marketing - The Next Level',14,1,NULL,NULL),(298,561,'2012-11-05','2012-12-10',NULL,'2012-11-03 23:38:37','2013-02-03 22:16:39','https://www.openlearning.com/courses/SPRT224982',NULL,5,NULL,14,1,NULL,NULL),(300,562,'2012-10-15','2012-11-12',NULL,'2012-11-03 23:42:42','2013-02-03 22:16:39','https://www.openlearning.com/courses/BUS832911','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_azfl7d-UIQ',3,'Services Marketing - Selling the Invisible',14,1,NULL,NULL),(301,563,'2013-01-07','2013-04-22',NULL,'2012-11-08 16:59:43','2013-02-03 22:16:39','https://www.coursera.org/course/calc1','http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkn9dj5JZn4',15,'Calculus One',1,1,'calc1_282_970360','Calculus One is a first introduction to differential and integral calculus, emphasizing engaging examples from everyday life.
