In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.\r\n\r\nIn Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship – a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.','The Ancient Greek Hero will use the latest technology to help students engage with poetry, songs, and stories first composed more than two millennia ago; this literature includes the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, a selection of lyric poetry (including the songs of Sappho), excerpts of prose history, seven tragedies, two Platonic dialogues, and the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue, On Heroes by Philostratus. Through English translations that have been carefully prepared and arranged for this course, as well as through supplementary comparative material drawn from cultures other than the Greek, and featuring a wide variety of media such as vase painting, European opera, and cinema—from Ingmar Bergman\'s version of Mozart\'s Magic Fluteto Ridley Scott\'s science fiction classic, Blade Runner—the course provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and ritual practices.

Although this course has been designed exclusively for edX, the course content reflects the topics taught in the MIT introductory biology courses and many biology courses across the world. As a student, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alters their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world. After you complete this course, you will have a foundation in biology that will allow you to understand the remarkable medical revolution going on today.'),(417,'Building an Information Risk Management Toolkit',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Building an Information Risk Management Toolkit Coursera Computer Science Barbara Endicott-Popovsky University of Washington Information, Tech & Design Computer Science: Systems & Security'),(418,'Information Security and Risk Management in Context',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Information Security and Risk Management in Context Coursera Computer Science Barbara Endicott-Popovsky University of Washington Information, Tech & Design Computer Science: Systems & Security'),(419,'Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Business & Management',' Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics Coursera Business & Management Eric Zivot University of Washington Economics & Finance'),(420,'Introduction to Psychology as a Science',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Humanities',' Introduction to Psychology as a Science Coursera Humanities Anderson D.

This course introduces the basic hardware structure of a modern programmable computer, including the basic laws underlying performance evaluation. We will learn, for example, how to design the control and data path hardware for a MIPS-like processor, how to make machine instructions execute simultaneously through pipelining and simple superscalar execution, and how to design fast memory and storage systems. The principles presented in the lecture are reinforced in the laboratory through the design and simulation of a register transfer level (RTL) implementation of a MIPS-like pipelined processor in Verilog. In addition, we will develop a cycle-accurate simulator of this processor in C, and we will use this simulator to explore processor design options.'),(426,'Statistics One',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Mathematics and Statistics',' Statistics One Coursera Mathematics and Statistics Andrew Conway Princeton University Statistics and Data Analysis'),(427,'Initiation à la programmation (en Java)',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Initiation à la programmation (en Java) Coursera Computer Science Jamila Sam Vincent Lepetit Jean-Cédric Chappelier École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne Ce cours initie à la programmation en utilisant le langage Java.
