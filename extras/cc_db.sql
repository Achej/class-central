Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale.

This course is not a series of independent lessons, but a deeper, more focused, unified look into the structure of English. Participants quickly discover that all English sentences follow the same principles by identifying the places contained in every sentence and the types of relationships and phrases found in those places. From day one, participants describe English sentences in a simple, straightforward manner and are able to apply this information for editing purposes. These skills facilitate the teaching and learning of other languages as well.\r\n\r\nCourse content is taken from linguistics and adapted to language teaching and learning.

The stages are: (1) develop; (2) test feasibility and plan; (3) launch; and (4) scale, grow and sustain.

Many of us squander our best opportunities to create value by making better decisions. What if we could judge the quality of our decisions at the time we make them, rather than waiting for their outcome? What if we could turn uncertainty to our advantage? Decision Quality (DQ) is a practical and systematic approach that methodically breaks down barriers and improves the quality and speed of important decisions.\r\n\r\nDecision Quality has proven to be an invaluable business tool for some of the largest corporations in the world. Companies that have adopted DQ for all their major decisions, like Chevron, are significantly outperforming their peer group of companies.\r\n\r\nNow you can learn to make decisions faster and smarter. In this five-week introductory course, you’ll work in teams to learn the DQ approach, which draws from the disciplines of business, engineering, psychology, organizational behavior, and decision science. Whether you’re an executive, a manager, an analyst, or a small-business owner, you’ll learn to improve your decision-making process, generate better alternatives, focus on relevant information without getting bogged down, apply sound reasoning, and take timely action more effectively and efficiently.

Los estudiantes desarrollarán un proyecto trabajando en equipo a distancia y habrá retroalimentación entre los diferentes grupos. Enseña como construir un flujo de caja y como calcular su valor actualizado neto (VAN) y otros indicadores de su rentabilidad. Cubre temas conceptuales como los costos y beneficios pertinentes. También aspectos prácticos como el tratamiento de la depreciación, la estimación del capital de trabajo, y la determinación del horizonte de evaluación y del valor residual. Y cubre asuntos más técnicos como el cálculo de la tasa con la que se deben descontar los flujos o costo del capital. Se explica como incorporar en la evaluación los aspectos estratégicos del proyecto. Enseña como valorizar su ventaja competitiva, y como incorporar las fuerzas que atentan contra la sustentación de las rentabilidades en el tiempo: la imitación, la sustitución y otras. Y explica como valorizar la flexibilidad inherente al proyecto, de ampliarse si se reciben buenas noticias, y de reducirse en caso contrario. El curso muestra también como hacer uso de la información disponible en la industria, en los estados financieros y en los precios de mercado. Respecto a estos precios se explica, por ejemplo, el método de valorización por múltiplos. Este permite definir un rango para el valor del proyecto, directamente a partir de información del mercado financiero, de precios de acciones de empresas comparables, cuando estas empresas existen. El curso resalta las mejores prácticas en la construcción de los flujos de cajas, en la incorporación de la estrategia y en la recolección de la información.

As a student, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alters their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world. After you complete this course, you will have a foundation in biology that will allow you to understand the remarkable medical revolution going on today.'),(417,'Building an Information Risk Management Toolkit',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Building an Information Risk Management Toolkit Coursera Computer Science Barbara Endicott-Popovsky University of Washington Information, Tech & Design Computer Science: Systems & Security Business & Management'),(418,'Information Security and Risk Management in Context',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Information Security and Risk Management in Context Coursera Computer Science Barbara Endicott-Popovsky University of Washington Information, Tech & Design Computer Science: Systems & Security Business & Management'),(419,'Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Business & Management',' Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics Coursera Business & Management Eric Zivot University of Washington Economics & Finance'),(420,'Introduction to Psychology as a Science',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Social Sciences',' Introduction to Psychology as a Science Coursera Social Sciences Anderson D.

This course introduces the basic hardware structure of a modern programmable computer, including the basic laws underlying performance evaluation. We will learn, for example, how to design the control and data path hardware for a MIPS-like processor, how to make machine instructions execute simultaneously through pipelining and simple superscalar execution, and how to design fast memory and storage systems. The principles presented in the lecture are reinforced in the laboratory through the design and simulation of a register transfer level (RTL) implementation of a MIPS-like pipelined processor in Verilog. In addition, we will develop a cycle-accurate simulator of this processor in C, and we will use this simulator to explore processor design options.'),(426,'Statistics One',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Mathematics and Statistics',' Statistics One Coursera Mathematics and Statistics Andrew Conway Princeton University Statistics and Data Analysis'),(427,'Initiation à la programmation (en Java)',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Initiation à la programmation (en Java) Coursera Computer Science Jamila Sam Vincent Lepetit Jean-Cédric Chappelier École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne Ce cours initie à la programmation en utilisant le langage Java.

As a student, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alters their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world.

The electronic structure and chemical bonding of materials is related to applications and engineering systems throughout the course. The on-campus version of the course has been taught for over thirty five years and is one of the largest classes at MIT. The class will cover the relationship between electronic structure, chemical bonding, and atomic order, and characterization of atomic arrangements in crystalline and amorphous solids: metals, ceramics, semiconductors, and polymers (including proteins). There will be topical coverage of organic chemistry, solution chemistry, acid-base equilibria, electrochemistry, biochemistry, chemical kinetics, diffusion, and phase diagrams. Examples will be drawn from industrial practice (including the environmental impact of chemical processes), from energy generation and storage (e.g. batteries and fuel cells), and from emerging technologies (e.g. photonic and biomedical devices).
