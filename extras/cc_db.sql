Although this course has been designed exclusively for edX, the course content reflects the topics taught in the MIT introductory biology courses and many biology courses across the world. As a student, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alters their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world. After you complete this course, you will have a foundation in biology that will allow you to understand the remarkable medical revolution going on today.'),(417,'Building an Information Risk Management Toolkit',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Building an Information Risk Management Toolkit Coursera Computer Science Barbara Endicott-Popovsky University of Washington Information, Tech & Design Computer Science: Systems & Security'),(418,'Information Security and Risk Management in Context',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Information Security and Risk Management in Context Coursera Computer Science Barbara Endicott-Popovsky University of Washington Information, Tech & Design Computer Science: Systems & Security'),(419,'Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Business & Management',' Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics Coursera Business & Management Eric Zivot University of Washington Economics & Finance'),(420,'Introduction to Psychology as a Science',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Humanities',' Introduction to Psychology as a Science Coursera Humanities Anderson D.

This course introduces the basic hardware structure of a modern programmable computer, including the basic laws underlying performance evaluation. We will learn, for example, how to design the control and data path hardware for a MIPS-like processor, how to make machine instructions execute simultaneously through pipelining and simple superscalar execution, and how to design fast memory and storage systems. The principles presented in the lecture are reinforced in the laboratory through the design and simulation of a register transfer level (RTL) implementation of a MIPS-like pipelined processor in Verilog. In addition, we will develop a cycle-accurate simulator of this processor in C, and we will use this simulator to explore processor design options.'),(426,'Statistics One',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Mathematics and Statistics',' Statistics One Coursera Mathematics and Statistics Andrew Conway Princeton University Statistics and Data Analysis'),(427,'Initiation à la programmation (en Java)',NULL,NULL,'Coursera','Computer Science',' Initiation à la programmation (en Java) Coursera Computer Science Jamila Sam Vincent Lepetit Jean-Cédric Chappelier École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne Ce cours initie à la programmation en utilisant le langage Java.
